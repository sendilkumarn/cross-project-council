## Description

This proposal codifies the process for projects should do before exiting the foundation. It includes a checklist to be used by the projects as part of going out of the OpenJS Foundation.

## Who would be responsible?

The Project, The foundation

## Why this proposal is important

A project can leave the foundation because of the following reasons:

* Project getting retired - No more active development
* Project not following Code of Conduct
* Project's decision
* Foundation's decision

It is important to codify this process that will ensure transparent and efficient way of removing a project from the foundation.

## What is necessary to complete this proposal

* Board buy in and approval to leave the foundation
* Receive a two-thirds supermajority vote of the CPC to remove the project.
* The project (if remains active) should transfer its assets to another non-profit [a (c)6 or (c)3 in the US].
* The project should remove all the references to foundation.
* The project should return all the infra, assets provided by the foundation.
* The foundation should remove the project references.
* The foundation should remove access to any assets provided by the foundation.

* What should we do during the investigation period (if any)?
* How we should educate the users about this removal?
* How to classify the removal based on the above reasons and will they have different approaches?
  - Do we have to fast track the removal process, if it is a Code of Conduct breach?
